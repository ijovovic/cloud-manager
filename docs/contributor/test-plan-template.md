# Test Plan Template

## **Purpose**

Explains the context in which the test plan applies to. A visual representation is strongly recommended to identify any documentation structure.

## Scope

Identifies the boundaries in terms of project life cycle and test levels, and describes any inclusions, exclusions, assumptions, and/or limitations. A visual representation or a matrix is strongly suggested as best practice to convey one or more of these details, but it’s not mandatory.

## Definitions

Provides a lexicon for the terms, abbreviations, and acronyms.

## Audience

The primary audience for this document are Engineer Leads and Software Engineer in Test involved in and responsible for the testing management operations. The secondary audience is Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) and its suppliers when involved in the testing activities.

## References

Lists other referenced documents or records and identifies repositories for system, software, and test information. The references may be separated into “external” references that are imposed from outside the organization and “internal” references that are imposed from within the organization. 

## **Context of testing**

### **Objective**

Identifies what problems this testing wants to solve and summarises how those problems could be solved. Current testing strategy can be mentioned here if it’s assumed it to be a possible cause of the problem.

### **Test scope**

Summarises the features of each test item to be tested. Also identifies any features of a test item that are to be specifically excluded from testing and the rationale for their exclusion.

### **Assumptions and constraints**

Describes any assumptions and constraints for the testing covered by this plan. These may include regulatory standards, requirements in the test policy and the organizational test practices, contractual requirements, project time and cost constraints, and availability of appropriately skilled staff, tools and/or environments.

## **Test strategy**

Describes the approach to testing the particular aspects. The use of visual representations, and the grouping of some of the information in the below subsections into one matrix, are recommended.

### **Test levels**

For a master test plan or a type test plan, this identifies the strategy adopted for each test item for specific levels of testing. The strategy should mention prioritization criteria when needed, as well as acceptance or countermeasures in case some test levels cannot be tested according to the identified ideal plan.

### **Test types**

For a master test plan or a level test plan, this identifies the strategy adopted for each test item for a specific type of test (e.g. safety level assignment and how that level will be fulfilled). The strategy should mention prioritization criteria when needed, as well as acceptance or countermeasures in case some test levels cannot be tested according to the identified ideal plan.

### **Test deliverables**

Identifies all test documentation that is to be delivered from the testing activity or equivalent information to be recorded electronically, for example in spreadsheets, databases, or dedicated test tools. It can also specify the format of the deliverables, certain common characteristics that the deliverables must possess and the tools to be used.

### **Entry and exit criteria for each phase**

Specifies when test processes for a given test phase can start and stop. This is to tailor the required quality to the appropriate phase of a project. A visual representation is highly recommended to convey this information.

### **Test completion criteria**

Specifies when test execution for a given test level, test type, or test technique can be considered complete and gives the rationale for a defined level of coverage (e.g. less than 100%). A representation in matrix form is recommended to list the criteria for all the given levels, types, or techniques.

### **Metrics to be collected**

Describes the metrics for which values are to be collected during the test activities. These metrics can be product or process-related if they are monitored at the project level to monitor the status of the development. Time to review the metrics will also be stated here.

### **Test environment requirements**

At a high level, specifies the necessary, current, and/or desired characteristics of the test environment, their reciprocal connection, and their usage policies (together with usage personnel definition). Information regarding selection, evaluation, acquisition, and support for each component part of the test environment may be included. A visual representation is highly recommended to convey some of this information.

## Appendix A. Quality Evidence

Provides a list of reports created during the test plan execution and all relevant quality evidence artifacts.
